/**
 * Error type for the session layer.

 * Thrown when a session or user response cannot be normalised - the envelope is
 * missing, or a required token or identifier field is absent or the wrong type
 * - so a malformed payload surfaces as a typed failure callers can branch on
 * with `instanceof` rather than a bare `Error`.
