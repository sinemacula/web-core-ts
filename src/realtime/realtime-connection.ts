/**

 * Server push is a separate concern from request/response. This port sits
 * BESIDE {@link HttpClient}, not on top of it - it models a persistent,
 * server-initiated stream rather than a one-shot request. SSE and WebSocket are
 * the two production adapters; tests substitute an in-memory fake.
